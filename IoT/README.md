## 1. IoT Server

### Getting Started

```
cd ~
git clone <Track2Gather-repo-url>
cd IFS4205-AY2223-S1-G2-Track2Gather/IoT/IoTServer
```

> From here on, all instructions for IoT Server are relative to current working directory i.e. `IoTServer/`

### Manual Configurations

List of manual configurations needed, before running the setting up the IoT server.
1. Configure SFTP User Credentials
2. Configure Logtail Source Token
3. Configure PostgreSQL IOT user credential
4. Configure iptables IP whitelist
5. Configure IoT Server socket address

### SFTP User Credentials

In the `Helpers/add_user.sh` file, replace `REDACTED` with the intended `sftp` user password.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Replace with actual password.
sftp_password="REDACTED"
sftp_user="sftp"

useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$sftp_user"
echo "$sftp_user:$sftp_password" | sudo chpasswd
```

Next, configure the `config.py`, to replace the `REDACTED` with the intended `sftp` user password mentioned above.

```
# SFTP
sftp_user="sftp"
sftp_password="REDACTED"
```

### Logtail Source Token

For the logtail token, you will need to obtain from the Logtail's dashboard. Then in the `config.py` file, replace the `REDACTED` with the obtained token value.

```
# Logtail
source_token="REDACTED"
```

### PostgreSQL IoT user credential

In the `config.py`, replace the `REDACTED` value with the actual password for IoT database user.

```
# PSQL
psql_password="REDACTED"
```

### iptables IP whitelist

> Each line should only contain one address.

To allow only the IoT receiver's IP to communicate with the IoT Server, simply replace or append the IoT receiver's IP address to `whitelistIPs.txt`.

```
192.168.232.1
```

### IoT Server socket address

In the `IoTServer.py`, modify the `LHOST` to the IoT server's IP address.

```
...
LPORT = 1337
# Replace with IoT Server's IP address (NUS)
LHOST = "<NUS-VM-IP>"
...
```

### Setting up

> IMPORTANT :warning: - If you intend to run this script on the NUS server, please make sure you keep two terminals open. So that the iptables configuration will not lock you out. The iptables has only been tested on non-NUS domain set up and yet to be tested on NUS domain. So, omit the iptables if needed.

> Assuming you have done `git clone` or copied the repository to `~/` where `~` refers to your home directory.

Once the manual [configurations](#manual-configurations) are done.
We can start running the `setup.sh` to configure the rest of the necessary configurations and installations for IoT Server. This can be done by running the following commands. Do also note, you will be prompted with the user's password.
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After running the script, the terminal should appear similar to output below and "hangs" there. This is normal as the IoT Server has started immediately after the set up is done.
```

```

### iptables configuration

> The actual iptables configuration is slightly modified from the sample in `setup.sh` to allow for batch whitelisting of IPs using `Helper/batchRecvIPs.sh`.

The configuration for the iptables are included in the `iptables-rules.txt` as a sample and shown below.
```
# Drop everything in-bound by default.
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP

# Track state of connection and allow those.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow ICMP.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT

# Enabling DNS Resolutions. (For logtail and perhaps nus domain)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

# Allow Receivers to SFTP and connect to IoT Server.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.232.1 --dport 22
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j ACCEPT -s 192.168.232.1 --dport 1337
```

### Sanity Check

To do a sanity check, you should be able to connect to the port and check the logs outputted on Logtail dashboard.

```
nc <IP> 1337

# After connecting (you will see no responses or anything), just type and send in anything e.g.
I am a test for sanity purposes.
```

## 2. IoT Dongle and Receivers


## Setting up IoT Dongles and Receivers

After setting up the server, you can begin to configure the Dongles and Receivers.

In this project, Receivers are simulated by Virtual Machines.
Each Receiver is assumed to be Bluetooth enabled, and has the repository cloned in the directory (`~/` or your home directory).
In this directory, the file `config.py` as shown should be replaced with a registered sftp user and password:
```
sftp_user="REDACTED"
sftp_password="REDACTED"
```
For these SFTP credentials, each Virtual Machine is assumed to have the IoT Server's ECDSA key fingerprint added to the list of known hosts.

On top of that, there should a designated Receiver (* *Setup Recv* *). * *Setup Recv* * acts as a normal Receiver but it will also contain the software needed to setup the IoT Dongles.
Thus, * *Setup Recv* * is assumed to have an Arduino IDE installed that is configured to run RFDuino boards, and that it has these libraries installed: (Crypto, micro-ecc).

To start the setup process for normal Receivers, you can run the following commands and you'll be prompted for the credentials:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
[sudo] password for healthauth:
```

For * *Setup Recv* *, you should run the following commands instead:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh all
[sudo] password for healthauth:
```

`setup.sh` performs the following operations:
> 1. Installs all tools that does not require manual configuration (python3-pip)
> 2. Copies `../GMS/gmsservice.py` to the directory (`~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/adafruit_ble/services/`)
> 3. Installs all Python Libraries and Packages as indicated in `requirements.txt`
> 4. Hardens the security by only allowing packets to and from the IoT Server
> 5. Initiates the bootstrap process by running `python3 bootstrap.py`

For * *Setup Recv* *, by running `./setup.sh all`, it will additionally perform the following operations:
> 6. Displays the default keys to be uploaded to the IoT Dongle by running `python3 bootstrap.py --all` instead
> 7. Syncs up any generated keys with the IoT Server by running `python3 sync.py` after you have completed uploading the sketches to the IoT Dongles


> ðŸ“” <span style="color:#3333ff">**NOTE:**</span>
>
> 1. Depending on the connectivity of the Bluetooth on the IoT Dongles and * *Setup Recv* *, `sync.py` might need to be run a few times to ensure that all keys are synced.
> 2. The battery of the Dongle might run out. If that is the case, `sync.py` has to be run again as a new IoT Dongle keypair will be generated once the IoT Dongle charges.

Once the setup is done for every Receiver, you can start the Receiver by manually running `python3 IoTRecv.py`.

## Sample Output when setting up the IoT Dongles and Receivers

Running `python3 bootstrap.py --all` can produce the following output:
```

## Unit Testing

In the `test` directory, run the following command
```
python -m unittest discover -s . -p "IoT*Tests.py"
```

This will run the `IoTServerTests.py` and `IoTRecvTests.py` files that performs unit testing for both `IoTServer.py` and `IoTRecv.py`.

## TODO

1. Integrate with DB end to pass data received on IoTServer into the DB.
2. Continue with Unit Testing of cases. (IN PROGRESS)
3. Write Github Actions workflow for automating testing of unit tests found in `test/` directory. (DONE)

## TODO (When REPO is publicly deployed)

1. Modify the `setup.sh` to clone from github repo.
2. Sanity test the `./setup.sh` to make sure everything is working.
